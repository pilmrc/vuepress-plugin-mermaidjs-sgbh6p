# Introduction

The system checks that 
**“route by mismatched WIP attribute”** routing rule types are selected at the route step.  If the rule is configured, the system first checks its **material parameters** . If a material has been specified but does not match WIP materials, then this rule does not apply and the system continues to the next row.  If materials were not specified or matches WIP materials, the system will check the **product family** .  If the product family has been specified but does not match the WIP product family, then this rule does not apply and the system will continue to the next row.If the product family was not specified or matches WIP materials, the system proceeds to check 
**customer parameters** .  If the customer has been specified but does not match the WIP customer, then the rule does not apply and the system continue to the next row. If a customer was not specified or matches the WIP customer, the system checks for **WIP attribute and WIP value parameters** .**Scenario 1** 
: If only WIP attribute is configured in the rule, this means the system validates if the WIP attribute is **not** found and a WIP value evaluation is **not** required. 
If a WIP attribute matches the configuration in the WIP attribute parameter, system needs to evaluate if there are remaining WIP attribute parameter. If any of the WIP attribute does *not* match the attribute parameter, then the system allows WIP to be routed to the destination route step.If all of the WIP attribute parameter matches, then the system retains the WIP in its current route step**.** **Scenario 2** 
: If WIP attribute and values are configured in the rule, this means a WIP attribute value evaluation is required. If a WIP attribute value matches the configuration in the WIP attribute parameter value, system needs to evaluate if there are remaining WIP attribute parameter value. If any of the WIP attribute value does *not* match the attribute value parameter, then the system allows WIP to be routed to the destination route step.If all of the WIP attribute parameter value matches, then the system retains the WIP in its current route step**.**
