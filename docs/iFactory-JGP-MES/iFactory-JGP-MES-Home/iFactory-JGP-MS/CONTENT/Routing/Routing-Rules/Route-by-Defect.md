# Introduction

The 
**route by indictment** feature allows end users to decide routing rule priorities, types and names.  This system permits operators to decide next route steps when there is more than one next route step.The 
**rule parameter section** permits end users to configure **“defect types”** and **“materials”**  as a consideration.  The system allows team members to enter multiple inputs as parameters:
- Defect Type

- Material Name

- Material Plant Code
The 
**destination operation section** allows end users to define next operation destinations.  The end user can add new routing rules with **“route by indictment”** route types. The system checks for an exact match regarding defect names, plant codes and material names. If plant codes and material names match the system proceeds with routing rules or fails WIP and WIP routes are determined by end users. If material names and plant codes has no associated values, the system excludes validating these two values.
