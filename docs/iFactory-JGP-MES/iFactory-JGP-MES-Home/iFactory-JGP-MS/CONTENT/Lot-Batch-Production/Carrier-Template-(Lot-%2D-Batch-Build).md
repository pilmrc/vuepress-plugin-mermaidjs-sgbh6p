# Introduction


**Carrier Template** 
- ACarrier Template is used as a preset format for aCarrier, used so that the format does not have to be recreated each timea Carrier is created.  A Carrier Template is given a Name and Description to aid in identification of the Template, and the Carrier Specific Details such as Rows, Columns, Maximum Cycles are define once on the template so that they do not need to be specified each time a Carrier is created. If the Configuration used by the Carrier Template is Validation Mask, any changes made to the Validation Mask will be reflected in the Carrier Template screen.
