# Introduction

For WIP with Material Release Type = "Assigned Serial Number", user is able to re-serialize the WIP that has been packed into a container. This is so that when a Serial Number label is inspected and found to be damaged, a new Serial Number from CodeSoft (a non-duplicate Serial Number app) can be printed to replace the Serial Number label and iFactory will be able to change the Serial Number but maintain the genealogy and history.
User can configure whether a WIP that is in packed status is allowed to re-serialize. This configuration is done at the

[Customer](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/iFactory-API/Retrieve-Customers.md)Maintenance screen.![image2018-7-31_16-1-37.png](/.attachments/31392861.png)


User will re-serialize a WIP at WIP Reserialization screen.
