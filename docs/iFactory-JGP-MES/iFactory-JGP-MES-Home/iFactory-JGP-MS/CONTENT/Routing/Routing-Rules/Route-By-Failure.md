# Introduction

The 
**route by symptom function** permits end users to determine routing rules priorities, rule names and the largest number has a lower priority. A team member decides next route steps when there is more than one next route step.The 
**rules parameter section** allows end users to configure symptom labels and materials. The system permits team member to enter multiple inputs regarding:
- Symptom Labels

- Material Names

- Material Plant Codes
The 
**destination operation section** defines next operation objectives. The phoenix system is capable of adding new routing rules with **“route by symptom”**  route types. It also checks symptom labels for an exact match. If material names and plant codes have a value, the system checks if values match. If values match; the system proceeds with routing rules or fails WIP and routes WIP to a destination defined by the end user.  If material names and plant codes have no value, the system excludes the validation of these two values.![image2013-4-16 12:28:40.png](/.attachments/29920040.png)
