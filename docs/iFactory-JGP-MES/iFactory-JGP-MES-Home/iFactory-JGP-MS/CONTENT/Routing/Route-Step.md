# Introduction

Route Steps define the basic process within the manufacturing of materials. 
Allow Retest On Failure
A collection of route step builds up a route. The configuration of route steps are performed in the **Edit Route Step** window. ![image2020-11-29_21-13-34.png](/.attachments/82903648.png)




It is possible to configure from this page pre-start rules, routing rules, 
[resources](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Resource/Resources-Maintenance.md), [certifications](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/User/Certification-(obsolete,-please-refers-to-security-Certification).md)and [assemble types](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/User-Guide/User-Guide-%2D-Assemble-Type.md)required in each of the route steps. To create Route & Route Step, refer to **Creation Steps** section in Route Step documentation. In order to segregate between the Bay Line in the production floor, Route Step is allowed to define by Manufacturing Area (Production Floor Bay/Line) according to the different resource with its own Manufacturing Area (e.g. Resource01 with MA01, Resource02 with MA02 respectively) OR shared resource with multiple different Manufacturing Area. (e.g. Resource01 with MA01, MA02 and MA03). This is applicable to only Repetitive Process Type.

#### Screen Activity


Route Step Edit enables user to perform the following activity:

- Configure general behavior of the route step (Example: Pull Step, Completion Step etc)

- Configure Pre-Start Rules

- Configure Routing Rules

- Create, View, Update, Delete Certifications required to operate in this route step

- Create, View, Update, Delete Resources for the route step

- Create, View, Update, Delete Assemble Types for the route step

- Create, View, Update, Delete Alternative Route step name for the route step



#### Pre Condition



- Route must be created first before user can add route steps into it

- Resources, certifications and assemble types must exist for association with the Route Steps

The SAP Work Center field becomes available for user configurationIs Delivery Fulfillment StepUsed in palletization step. If checked, the route step will be identified as delivery fulfillment step. Only allow resources and certifications assignment. Since there is no WIP to start, it does not allow adding pre-start rules, routing rules or assembly types. Incoming and outgoing connections arrows are also not allowed.Is Delivery Audit StepIf checked, the route step will be identified as delivery audit step. Delivery Audit is performed after packout to determine if the items packed matches the items required by the order.
Except for assigning resources and certifications, it does not allow adding pre-start rules, routing rules or assembly types. Incoming and outgoing connections is also not allowed. Allow Manual Test OverrideIf checked, the Manual Test Entry station access (the Manual Test Entry button via Station Login) is available on top of the route step's station access. User is able to decide to enter either station for WIP processing. Example, this option is turned on for Manual Inspection Entry step. When user scans the resource and route step selection in Station Login, user can decide if they wanted to perform Manual Inspection or Manual Test.Enable Hermes ControllerIf checked, the Hermes service will be linked to this particular Step resource. In this case Hermes service can control the board from going from Upstream machine to downstream machine.
Generate IBN On SplitIf checked, the Internal Batch Number will be generated during split so that the process can be optimized.Restrict Manufacturing Area Change
Option to turn On/Off. If turn On, WIP is not allowed to change Manufacturing Area during the Station Login / Operation Station start whereas turn Off to allow WIP to change the manufacturing area according to the provided Resource.Copy![image2020-11-29_21-39-53.png](/.attachments/82903653.png)

Pre-Start Rules TabField
Description
PriorityThe sequence where the pre-start rule will be executed. A smaller number has a higher priority and it will be executed first.Rule TypePhoenix has a list of pre-start rule types for user selection. Different rule types call for different rule parametersRule NameThe unique name given to the rule typeRule ParametersDepending on the Rule Type, user is required to configure the corresponding rule parameters. The value configured will be used to execute the rule. 
For example, **Rule Type** : Basic Random Sampling has **Rule Parameter** : Sampling Percentage
User is required to enter the sampling percentage. If the sampling percentage entered is 50%, then the WIP has a 50% probability to be used for sampling.Routing Rule TabFieldDescriptionPriorityThe sequence where the routing rule will be executed. A smaller number has a higher priority and it will be executed first.Rule TypePhoenix has a list of routing rule types for user selection. Different rule types call for different rule parametersRule NameThe unique name given to the rule typePrompt Current OperatorThis is applied when there are more than one routing steps available after the WIP completion in the current route step.
If checked, the operator completing the current route step is required to select the next route step to queue the WIP
If unchecked, the WIP will be queued in all of the possible next route step. The WIP can be started at any of the mentioned route step. Once started, the WIP is no longer in queue in the mentioned route steps.Destination OperationThe route step to route the WIP if the rule is metRule ParametersDepending on the Rule Type, user is required to configure the corresponding destination operation and/or rule parameters. The value configured will be used to execute the rule. 
For example, **Rule Type** : Route By Material has **Destination Operation** : FA, **Rule Parameter** : Assembly_X
If Assembly_X is completed at this route step, then it will be routed to route stepFAResources TabField
Description
SequenceSequence field to be optional to enter (If no sequence, it means the resource to be considered after all the sequenced resources. Adding same sequence no. to different resources is possible. User can Add, edit or delete Resource sequence anytime.
For Example if we have this configuration:
<table class="wrapped confluenceTable"><tbody><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><span style="color: black;">Seq.

ResourcesConfigure available resources filtered according to the Manufacturing Area of Route Step. For example, a torque driver tool may be assigned to the route step to allow the operator to assemble parts. Resource can be shared resource (e.g. Resource01 with MA01, MA02 and MA03) or independent resource for each different manufacturing area (e.g. Resource01 with MA01 and Resource02 with MA02 respectively).Certifications TabFieldDescriptionCertificationConfigure the certifications required by the operator to operate in this route step. For example, an operator must have a valid torque usage certification before they can work with a torque driver resource 
Assemble Types TabField
Description
Assemble TypeIf it is an assembly route step, user can configure the assemble type here. When the material arrives at the route step, system will prompt operator to assemble the component if the Assemble Type on the route step and the Assemble Type on the material match. Assemble Type is configured in [Material](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Product/Material.md)'s Assemble TabAlternative Names TabFieldDescriptionAdd Alternative NameAdd a new alternative name for the Route Step.
