# Introduction

Route Step Type enables user to define specific routing behavior and configure certifications required. To ease repetitive configuration, Route Steps can be grouped into Route Step Type and all the flags and certification configured will be inherited by the Route Step. During creation of 
[Route Steps](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Routing/Route-Step-Type.md)in [Route Maintenance](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Routing/Route-Step-Type.md), user is required to specify the Route Step Type alongside with the Route Step Name.

### How to get there?

#### Screen Activity


Route Step Type enables user to perform the following activity:

- Configure route step type properties

- Create, View, Update and Delete certifications required by the operator to work on the route step



#### Pre Condition


Certification must be created first before user can associate it to the Route Step Type

Screen DependencyThe following screen(s) has direct dependency with Route StepÂ 

- [Route Step Type](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Routing/Route-Step-Type.md)
