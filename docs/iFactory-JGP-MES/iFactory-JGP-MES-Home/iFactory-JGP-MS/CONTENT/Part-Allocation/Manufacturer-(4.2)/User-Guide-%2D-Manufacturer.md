# Introduction



## ***Introduction to Manufacturer***  



The 
**Manufacturer** screen is used to create a new **Manufacturer** or to retrieve information of **Manufacturer** previously created for a **Feeder/Tray** . The **Manufacturer** **Name** cannot be greater than 100 chars.

## ***How to navigate to Manufacturer***  



Please refer to the user guide 
***[Navigating to iFactory Screens](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Menu-Navigation/User-Guide-%2D-Navigating-to-iFactory-Groups-and-Screens.md)***  
for detail information.


## ***Why is this screen important?***  


Repetitive manufacturing regularly utilizes feedersand trays to insert parts on SMT machines.  We must be able to track the performance of a feeder and its manufacturer in order to gain the greatest degree of visibility of this critical equipment.
