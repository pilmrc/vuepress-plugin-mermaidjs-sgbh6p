# Introduction


- When trying to create a new assembly. I am receiving an error [Material not found]

**CAUSE** 
The BOM associated to the material was a Type: Super.

**SOLUTION** 
- Verify the material exists

- Verify the material is a WIP material

- Verify the BOM exists

- Verify the BOM is in validity date appropriate for the configuration

- Verify the BOM is set as fixed type [Super will not work for this configuration]
