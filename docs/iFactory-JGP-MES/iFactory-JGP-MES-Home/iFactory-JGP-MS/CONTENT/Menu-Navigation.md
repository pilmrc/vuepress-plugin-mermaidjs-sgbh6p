The side bar menu provides a way to navigate to the various iFactory features.  The menu consists of menu groups and items.  Most menu items are situated under menu groups, however there are a few exceptions such as the link to the Wiki, the Generic station and station login features at the top of the menu (shown below).

By default the menu groups will be collapsed but can be expanded using the '˅' icon to the right of the group name.  Expanding a menu group will make the menu items in that menu group visible.  To collapse the group click the '^' icon next to the menu group name.

The 'Filter Navigator' feature can be used to quickly find a menu item without the need to expand all the menu groups.  When text is entered into the 'Filter Navigator' text box the system will filter the menu to any items (including menu groups) that partially match the string.  For example: entering 'pro' into the 'Filter Navigator' text box will show all the menu items that contain 'pro' (not only ones that start with 'pro').
The menu will also show the containing parent group even if the name does not match the entered filter.  For example menu group 'Orders' is shown (below) even though the menu group name does not contain the entered filter string 'pro'.

The 'Show/Hide Menu Items' feature (below the 'Filter Navigator' feature) allows the user the ability to show menu items that are being hidden from their view due to the user not having permission required to see a specific menu item.   The option hides the items the user doesn't have permission for by default.  When clicked the slash through the eye icon will disappear indicating the system will show the menu items the user doesn't have permission for.  These items will display in an italicised font.  For example the menu items 'SAP Storage Locations' and 'Shift Maintenance' show in italics since the user doesn't have permissions for these.
