***SOLUTION***  
Created an IM ticket with the ServiceNow and escalated the issue to the GCIA team. I Suspected this was an issue with
the DG from the beginning = digital guardian client.
- A member
from the GCIA team had me run a package to uninstall the client 
- The
support memberhad me try ifactoryagainand this time the menu shows just like magic
- The
support member is going to escalate the issue to DG support so they can resolve the issue on the DG console
- The DG client I have installed is 7.5.2.0054

- Digital Guardian added an

exclusion in sent to all the machines in Jabil:
Here is the screenshot showing the menu display
