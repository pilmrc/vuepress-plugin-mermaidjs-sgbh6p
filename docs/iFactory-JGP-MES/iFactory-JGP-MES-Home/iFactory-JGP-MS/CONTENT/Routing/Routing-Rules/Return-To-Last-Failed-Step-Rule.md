# Introduction

The phoenix system can only determine destinations by querying the database at runtime, but not during configuration. However this function will be disabled for this rule type.  The 
**return WIP to last failed step rule**  permits end user to determine routing rule types, names and priorities; the largest number has the lowest priority. The system permits operators to determine next route steps when there is more than one next route step for condition routing.

This rule can be used by Batch Production to return Carrier/Lot to last failed step upon completion of a Carrier/Lot at a Route Step
