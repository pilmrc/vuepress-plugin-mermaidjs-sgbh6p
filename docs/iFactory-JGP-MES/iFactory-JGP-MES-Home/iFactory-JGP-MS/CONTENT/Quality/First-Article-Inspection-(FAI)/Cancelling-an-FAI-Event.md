# Introduction

A user that has sufficient 
[permissions](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/User/Permissions.md)can cancel an 'in progress' FAI event from the [FAI Events](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Quality/First-Article-Inspection-(FAI)/FAI-Events.md)screen.Only FAI events that are 'In Progress' and are not associated to any failed WIP may be cancelled.  If the user has sufficient access, the 'Cancel' button will be available when clicking on an 'In Progress' FAI event in the FAI Events screen.

When the 'Cancel' button is clicked the system will prompt the user to confirm they want to cancel the selected event.  If the user clicks the 'Cancel' button in the 'Cancel FAI Event' modal window they will be returned back to the FAI Events screen without the selected event being cancelled.

If the user clicks the 'Submit' button in the  'Cancel FAI Event' modal window the event will be cancelled by the system and a success message to this effect will be displayed.  Once a FAI event is cancelled it cannot be made active again.
All WIP associated to the FAI Event will retain its FAI inspection status regardless of the event being cancelled.

Cancelled FAI events can be viewed from the FAI Events page by setting the 'Event Status' to 'Cancelled'.
