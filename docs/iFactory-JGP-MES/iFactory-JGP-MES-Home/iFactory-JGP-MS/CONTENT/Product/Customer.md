# Introduction

A Customer is a company that employs Jabil to design and manufacture products for them. As Jabil has many customers, it is crucial for its shop floor system to segregate product manufacturing by customers while keeping the manufacturing data and processes independent from each other. Some of Jabil's customers are Cisco, HP, Agilent, Isilon, NetApp and many more. 

How to get there?

### Screen Activity


Customer Maintenance enables user to perform the following activity:

- Create, view, update and delete customer

- Configure specific customer requirements for Serial Number, Inventory ID and Batch

- Configure specific customer requirement for Handling Unit trigger point

- Configure the email IDs against which MSD related alert mails to be sent by the system



#### Screen Dependency


Most screens in shop floor system has dependencies to Customer. Modification on Customer that is active and already running in production is highly not advisable.

Partner NumberAllows user to associate SAP's partner number(s) with shop floor defined customer. Partner number will be included in the Customer Order message from SAP to shop floor. Based on the partner number and the partner number/shop floor customer association done here, shop floor system will be able to identify customer for the order.

Serial Number ConstraintDepending on customer Serial Number requirement, there are two types of serial number constraint

- Unique by Customer - Every Serial Numbers for the selected Customer will be unique

- Unique by Material - Serial Numbers are unique by Material under this Customer.

Example: In Cisco, Assembly_A & Assembly_B can have the same Serial Number Expand All turn onExpand each of the panelsExpand All turn offCollapse all of the panelsRe-evaluate Inqueue WIP by Routing Rule ChangeIf Enabled - Re-evaluate affected in queue WIPs upon saving route base on the changes on routing rule.

If Disabled – Default value. No re-evaluate action on the in queue WIPs upon saving route with routing rule change. (For more details, please refer to Routing Rules wiki.)Allow Packed WIP to Reserialize
If enabled, user is able to

Restrict Reserialized WIP SN to ReleaseIf enabled, User is not allowed to release or re-serialize the Original Serial number which has been re-serialized to other serial number. e,g, abc001 has been re-serialized to abc002, so the abc001 should not allow to be released in the WIP Release or re-serialize in the WIP Reserialization screen. This is only applicable to the WIP Material Release Type = “Assigned Serial Number”.Auto BatchAuto Batch is used during WIP Release. With this option enabled, operator is able to release WIP without an existing Batch. In WIP Release screen, after the operator clicks the "Generate WIP" button, shop floor system 
will auto generate a new Batch Number and displays the Batch Number to the operator. Batch Next NumberIf Auto Batch is enabled, this field becomes a required field. The Next Number configured here will determine the format of the auto-generated Batch Number.

Turn on this option to allow Parser Service to process the Assembly Progression (Progression/Conversion/Upgrade). Assembly Number, Revision, Version in the Parser file are optional if this option is turned off and no Assembly Progression is configured. This option is available if the Serial number Constraint is "Unique by Customer". Parser Service is allowed for progression to the same route only.**Division Option Tab** **Field** 
**Description** 
Customer/Division
It is the customer/division that will be affected by the configuration. Leave blank by default.
Is Slot Scan Required
It is forcing to scan the slot (Module ID and TrackID) when the part is allocated in
[Equipment Part Allocation](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Part-Allocation/Equipment-Part-Allocation.md)screenWhen OFF the system is not asking to scan the slot, but take the slot directly from

This is a check to be sure the user is putting the feeder/GRN in the correct slot.
Is AutoTransport GRN Removal
It is the key to configure the auto removal functionality in part allocation.
When OFF the system will alert with duplicate value when same feeder/GRN appears in two different location.
When ON the tool doesn't provide any alert, but will automatically remove the Feeder/GRN from old location and put it in the new location.
This setting is not checked when the setup sheet with the feeder/GRN scanned is already installed. In that case the behavior is always like key OFF.
Enforce GRN for Serialized MaterialThis to enforce the user to fill up the GRN during the part allocation if it is turn ON whereas the GRN is not required during part allocation. By default the option will set to "YES".TSM/MSD Alert ThresholdIt is the time (in minutes) used to provide the alert before the MSD component expires or the
[Bake Process](iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Product/Customer.md)Maximum Bake Time is reached (when configured). Default Value: 30 minsFor example, if the MSD Component has 2 hrs as Maximum Exposure Time, an alert appears (by default) at GRN scanning when the part stays out of the bag for 1h30m
If the Maximum Bake Time is 4 hours and 20 minutes, a notification will be sent after 3h50m saying that the part will complete the bake process in 30 mins
Is Qty Scan RequiredBy default is ON, means user require to provide qty valu during SV scan after GRN. Switch to off will skip qty entry in SV.Is Module Slot ComboBy default is OFF, means that user require to provide Module value first then follow by slot durig SV scan. Switch to ON will allow user to combine both module slot as 1 value.

GRN DocumentIt is the division level GRN Document. Leave blank by default. 
The priority is lower than material level GRN Document which means system will using material level GRN Document value to print GRN Label if both division level and material level GRN Document has value. 
Field Retain Time Limit (seconds)To control each focus field can retain for how long, exceed the configured limit user should re-enter start from beginning of the entry on the screen. Value 0 means no control, value " 0 will activate this limit control. Available screens:
