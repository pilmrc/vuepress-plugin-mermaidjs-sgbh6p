# Introduction

The phoenix system checks that 
**“route by WIP attribute”** routing rule types are selected at the route step.  If the rule is configured, the system first checks its **material parameters** . If a material has been specified but does not match WIP materials, then this rule does not apply and the system continues to the next row.  If materials were not specified or matches WIP materials, the system will check the **product family** .  If the product family has been specified but does not match the WIP product family, then this rule does not apply and the system will continue to the next row.If the product family was not specified or matches WIP materials, the system proceeds to check 
**customer parameters** .  If the customer has been specified but does not match the WIP customer, then the rule does not apply and the system continue to the next row. If a customer was not specified or matches the WIP customer, the system checks for **WIP attribute and WIP value parameters** .**Scenario 1** 
: If only WIP attribute is configured in the rule, this means the system validates if the WIP attribute is found and a WIP value evaluation is **not** required. If a WIP attribute is not found, the system retains WIP in its current route step and displays a message **“require WIP attribute was not found and WIP will not be routed.** ” If a WIP attribute is located and no attribute value evaluation is required, the system allows WIP to be routed to its destination route step and display a message **“the WIP attribute was found and WIP routing was triggered. No attribute value evaluation was requested.”** **Scenario 2** 
: If WIP attribute and values are configured in the rule, this means a WIP attribute value evaluation is required.  If a WIP attribute value matches the value configured in the WIP attribute requires a parameter value, then the system allows WIP to be routed to a destination route step and displays a message **“ WIP attribute was found with a certain value and triggering routing.”** If a WIP attribute value does not match the configuration in the WIP attribute required parameter value, the system retains WIP in its current route step and displays a message **“WIP attribute value did not match configured value and the WIP will not be routed.”**
