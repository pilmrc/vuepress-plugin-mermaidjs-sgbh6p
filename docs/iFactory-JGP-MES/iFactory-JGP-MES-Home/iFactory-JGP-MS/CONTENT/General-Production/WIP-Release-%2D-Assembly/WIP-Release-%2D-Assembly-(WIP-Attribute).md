# Introduction

User is able to configure a list of WIP Attributes (by Material) using 
[Attribute Assignment](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/General-Production/Attribute-Assignment.md), to be captured during WIP Release. This is so that user can associate Cavity Number and Mold Number during WIP release and do not have to associate one by one during assembly as well as able to restrict same cavity and same mold in a box.

### Printing Attribute On WIP Label During Release


User will be able to print attribute value(s) during WIP release so that the attribute information will be available on the WIP label. 
If Attribute Assignment is configured for WIP Release and Attribute is configured as a field value in the Release Document, the WIP label (PAS file) printed when Submit button is triggered will contain the attribute information. 
This is applicable to material with "Assigned Serial Number" Release Type. For 
material with "Generate Serial Number" Release Type, it is only applicable if the Release Action is “Generate and Release” because attribute is only assigned during release and label is printed when serial number is generated.
Sample scenario for "Generate Serial Number" Release Type:
