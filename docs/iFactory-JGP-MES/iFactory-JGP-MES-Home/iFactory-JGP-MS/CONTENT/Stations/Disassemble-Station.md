# Introduction

In order to segregate between the Bay Line in the production floor, Route Step is allowed to define by Manufacturing Area (Production Floor Bay/Line) according to the different resource with its own Manufacturing Area (e.g. Resource01 with MA01, Resource02 with MA02 respectively) OR shared resource with multiple different Manufacturing Area. e.g. Resource01 with MA01, MA02 and MA03. This is applicable to only Repetitive Process Type.
WIP can be updated with the "Last Scanned Manufacturing Area" of the operation station completed. With the Manufacturing Area of the WIP during the operation start, system refer to "Restrict to Manufacturing Area Change" option at Route Step, if turned On, user will be stopped to change the Manufacturing Area whereas if turned Off to allow WIP to be changed to other Manufacturing Area. 
If Option is turned On, scanned WIP to be notified that the Resource at the Route Step have different Manufacturing Area whereas the option is turned Off, WIP can into resource at Route Step other than the Manufacturing Area and "Last Scanned Manufacturing Area" of the WIP to be changed to the Manufacturing Area of Resource at Route Step.

- If the Route Step option "Restrict WIP Manufacturing Area Change" is turned "
ON":
- If scanned WIP MA is same with scanned resource MA, operation start

- If scanned WIP MA is different than scanned resource MA, system to prompt toaster message and operation halt.

- If the Route Step option "Restrict WIP Manufacturing Area Change" is turned "
OFF":
- If scanned WIP MA is same with scanned resource MA, Operation start

- If scanned WIP MA is different than the scanned resource MA:

- Operation start

- "Last scanned Manufacturing Area" of the WIP change to the MA of the Route Step
