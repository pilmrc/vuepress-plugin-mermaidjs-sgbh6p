# Introduction

User is able to configure a list of Lot Attributes (by Material) using 
[Attribute Assignment](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/General-Production/Attribute-Assignment.md), to be captured during Lot Release. This is so that user can associate Cavity Number and Color during Lot release and do not have to associate one by one during production as well as able to restrict same cavity and same color in a box.
**Pre Condition** 
The material type must be LotBatch.
