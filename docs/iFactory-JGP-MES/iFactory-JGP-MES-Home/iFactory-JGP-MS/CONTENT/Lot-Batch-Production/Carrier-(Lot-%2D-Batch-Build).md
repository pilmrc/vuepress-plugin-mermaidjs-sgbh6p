# Introduction


**Carrier -**  
A kind of handling device / tote / tray / fixture used to transport items from one location to another that has a unique identifier assigned to it. In the context of this module the Carriers are a Material Carrier used to transport materials generally within the factory. This is not to be confused with a Carrier that provides shipping services like FedEx, or UPS, USPS, etc. Â There are several variations that are in production at Jabil, below are a few examples of Carriers. Each of these Carriers can be uniquely identified and may transport non-serialize or serialized materials.
