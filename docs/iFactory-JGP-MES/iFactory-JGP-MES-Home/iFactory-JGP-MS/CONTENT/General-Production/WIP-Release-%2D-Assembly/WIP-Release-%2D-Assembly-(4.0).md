# Introduction

For Repetitive production it is needed to created the WIP to start production for the order. The WIP release screen allows user to release WIP that belongs to an assembly into the first step of the specified route or create a WIP without release to a route for panalized and later on release to a Route. A unique WIP ID is created for each of released WIP.

#### Screen Activity


WIP Release - Assembly enables user to perform the following activity:

- Release WIP without specifying an order

- Release WIP into an existing batch (choose Existing Batch option)

- Release WIP into a system generated batch ID (choose Auto Batch Id option)

- Release WIP once it is panelized

- Specify the Route/Version. Only active routes are available for selection. New and Inactive routes are filtered out.

- Specify the Initial Route Step to release the WIP

- Specify the quantity of WIP to release

- Generate labels on release
For Assigned Serial Number WIP Release type , WIP Release fields will be auto disabled once user click the " Submit" button. User can reset the selected fields by "Clear" button.

![image2022-5-13_8-4-32.png](/.attachments/116359241.png)





#### Steps To Release when Material Release Type is 


"ASSIGNED SERIAL NUMBER" 
and using Panels:
**As prerequisite, the WIP have to be**  
[panelized](iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/General-Production/WIP-Release-%2D-Assembly/WIP-Release-%2D-Assembly-(4.0).md).
- Select the Customer/Division.

- Select the Material.

- Select the Assembly.

- Select the Route/Version.

- Select the Route Step to release to.

- Scan one of the Serial Number from a Panel that matches the validation mask configured for the material.

- Click on Submit and the system will show a toastr message with a summary of what was released.




#### Steps To Release when Material Release Type is 


"ASSIGNED SERIAL NUMBER" 
and not using Panels:

- Select the Customer/Division.

- Select the Material.

- Select the Assembly.

- Select the Route/Version.

- Select the Route Step to release to.

- Scan a Serial Number that matches the validation mask configured for the assembly or material. If Assembly Validation Mask configured, then prior to match with it’s pattern. If Assembly Validation Mask not configured, then match with material validation mask pattern.

- Click on Submit and the system will show a toastr message with a summary of what was released.
Note: WIP Serial number to be assigned for the Assembly should not been re-serialized before if the Customer is configured with the "Restrict Reserialized WIP SN to Release" enabled.
![image2022-5-13_8-4-32.png](/.attachments/39649447.png)







#### *USING EXISTING BATCH NUMBER* 


If using an existing batch number (i.e. customer is not configured with auto batch) then the user needs to search and assign to an existing batch number before continuing with the process.
The following configuration parameters are enforced:-

- System will filter the batch numbers to only display those associated to the configured material.


- System will not allow the maximum build Qty to be exceeded, so those not configured to be unlimited (set to 0), will not be selectable if the maximum build Qty is reached or the wip release qty would exceed the maximum configured value.


- For those assemblies that were already generated without release, when they are entered for release, the user will not be prompted to enter a batch.




#### *Next Number with Prompt value* 


If using Segment Type “PROMPT” in next number configuration, user can input the value during WIP Release.
If WIP Release Type is 'Generate Serial Number', Release Action is 'Generate and Release' and 'Generate' will show Prompt popup page to 
fill inthe prompt value for the next number of WIP serial number.Fill in the input value or list value, click 'Save' button.
![image2019-9-10_10-58-54.png](/.attachments/57638918.png)


System will show the green message that serial number will include the prompt values defined by Next Number.
![image2020-4-14_17-51-0.png](/.attachments/69632158.png)





#### *Printers and label handling on WIP Release* 


If a single printer is configured to the initial route step and the material has a document assigned, the label will be automatically printed on release of WIP to the route (Note: applies only when WIP not previously generated).
If the WIP has a document assigned, but no printer configured, an error will be thrown and the user is prevented from generating or releasing the WIP.
![image2020-4-14_17-54-27.png](/.attachments/69632159.png)




If there is a document assigned and there is more than 1 configured printer, the user has the option to select the desired printer:
![image2020-4-14_17-56-35.png](/.attachments/69632160.png)



If the generate or release is validated, the label is printed and the WIP is generated/released successfully:




#### *Unserialized to Serialized Process* 


This feature provides 
the ability to assign/generate Serial Numbers for units produced by Lot/Batch production and associate it with the Lot number during WIP Release - Assembly. 
It is enabled if the Material Process Type for WIP is "Repetitive / Board Build" and if the WIP assembly revision is configured to link with Lot/Batch material in 
[Assembly Configuration](/iFactory-JGP-MES/iFactory-JGP-MES-Home/iFactory-JGP-MS/CONTENT/Product/Assembly-Configuration.md). User is required to scan a Carrier number with a lot that matches the 
“From Lot/Batch Material” configured in assembly configuration screen
and the lot must also be in 'Complete' status.After WIP is released:

- System will associate the assigned/generated serial number with the lot number.


- Lot with units that has been serialized will have a new lot status “Consumed”. Lot with “Consumed” status cannot be used at other screens (Lot Transfer, Lot Scrap, Lot Hold, Lot Move).


- The relationship between Lot and WIP is shown in WIP view.

#### *WIP Release to Manufacturing Area:* 


This feature provides the ability to assign/generate Serial Numbers to Manufacturing Area associated on Route Step. It is enabled if the Material Process Type for WIP is "Repetitive / Board Build". User is required to associate the Manufacturing Area (Bay Line) to the Route Step. There is a new field created to show the associated Manufacturing Area (MA) of the Initial Route Step.
If user enabled the Release Action " "Generate and Release" or "Release already Generate" option, show the Manufacturing Area field whereas Release Action " "Generate" option enabled then Manufacturing Area field to be disabled.


- Value to be showed according to the provided Initial Route Step MA configured in the Route Maintenance


- If more than one MA configured for Route Step, User can select one of the MA only


- If only one MA configured for Route Step, field to auto select the only option
