# Introduction


- WIP "SX410-301530-0014" is already started at Route Step "Prod Order Packout" on Resource "MEMISL052", cannot start


*CAUSE* 
The WIP has a START process step history but is not actually packed to any container due to connection loss or other system issue. Therefore, the Packout station does not allow the same WIP to be packed or START again.

*SOLUTION* 

- Click on "Abort" button shown in image below to abort the started WIP.


- Repack the same WIP serial number.
